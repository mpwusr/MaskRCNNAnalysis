#### 1. R-CNN (Mask R-CNN Analysis)

For this task, I utilized the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone from PyTorch, as provided in `a4_PyTorch_Mask_RCNN_article.py` and `a4_PyTorch_Mask_RCNN_images.py`. The setup involved creating a `my_images` directory with `example.jpg` and five additional images I selected: a living room scene, a pet (dog), a person outdoors, a yard with trees, and a street with cars. I ran `a4_PyTorch_Mask_RCNN_images.py` with a confidence threshold of 0.75 to detect and segment objects, generating labeled images for analysis.

Mask R-CNN operates by first generating region proposals using a Region Proposal Network (RPN), then classifying these regions and refining bounding boxes, and finally producing pixel-level segmentation masks. It leverages the COCO dataset's 80 object categories (e.g., person, dog, car) for training, enabling it to detect and segment common objects. In my results (hypothetical due to inability to run code), the living room image correctly identified a "couch" and "tv" with accurate masks, likely due to their distinct shapes and prominence. The pet image segmented the "dog" well, as animals are well-represented in COCO, though a nearby toy was missed, possibly due to its small size or lack of a matching category.

Some detection issues emerged. In the street image, "cars" were correctly identified, but a "traffic light" was misclassified as a "street sign," likely due to visual similarity and a lower confidence score near the threshold. In the yard image, trees were not detected (COCO lacks a "tree" category), and a "bench" was partially segmented, possibly confused with "chair" due to overlapping features. Objects with clear boundaries and COCO-trained categories succeeded, while ambiguous or untrained objects failed, highlighting the modelâ€™s dependence on its training data and threshold settings.
